# BoardApp
This project was born in the need for some way to improve in the visualization of the chess board. They say that being able to recognize de column and row of the board squares is a glampse is a powerfull way to start the learning of this ancient game of kings.

To play this game, what you have to do is just download the .c file, and compile with the gcc. No compile flags are needed.
Or you can just copy the code and paste it on any online compiler online, such as replit, onlinegbd...
It is a very lightweight application, once its purpose is simple as well.
The execution of the game in pretty intuitive, and in the gameplay, all you have to do is insert the square's row and column in the algebric format (a1).
The rigth guesses will be marked as Verified (V), the worng guesses will be marked as errors (X), the square to be named will display the number of the actual square to be guessed, and all the others will be an question mark (?)

==============================================================
The next atualization intends to implement some colors to become more intuitive and funnier...
=============================================================
Stay tuned in this repo, cause problably this project will turn into a new project (maybe on this same repo), in javascript, using all the power of css to make a style even more intuitive and lots of more good looking.
